# Conservative Stage {#Bookmark5}

The bG+ conservative stage aims to define the requirements of what a
comprehensive graph theory would look like, and we could use the field
**terminology** as a proxy for doing that.

Using the current field terminology we can

-   find out the **requirements** for a comprehensive theory

-   define our **scope of work**

-   build a **preferred terminology**, getting rid of any ambiguities

The process for it is described in Fig. 2.
